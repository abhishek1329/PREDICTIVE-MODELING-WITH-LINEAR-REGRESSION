Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a linear regression model using Python and popular data science libraries. The model is trained on a dataset with a continuous target variable, split into training and testing sets, and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. Additionally, the model's predictions on the test set are visualized to assess its accuracy.

Steps Covered
Dataset: The model uses a dataset with a continuous target variable. This could be any dataset where you want to predict a numerical outcome based on one or more input variables.

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using a suitable method (e.g., train-test split from scikit-learn).

Model Training: The linear regression model is trained using the training data. This involves fitting the model to learn the coefficients that best fit the data.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using common regression metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): This measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
R-squared (R2): This indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
Visualization: Visualizations are created to understand the model's performance:

Regression Line Plot: Shows the fitted regression line based on the training data.
Actual vs. Predicted Values Plot: Compares the actual target values from the test set with the predicted values from the model.
